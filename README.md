# Hi, I'm Fabian Döller ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18350557/176309783-0785949b-9127-417c-8b55-ab5a4333674e.gif)
I'm a 24-year-old Computer Science student at the University of Constance.

## About me
- 🎓 Studying Computer Science at the University of Constance since 2022.
- 💻 Started coding around 6 years ago with Java, and worked with it for almost 4 years in school.
- 🐧 Transitioned from Windows to Arch Linux and explored the limitations of Java, leading me to learn C.
- 🤖 Used C for programming Arduino with AVR, finding it more suitable for Linux system tasks.

## Technologies & Skills
- ☕ **Java**: 5 years of experience.
- 🐦 **C**: Intermediate, especially in a Linux environment.
- 🐧 **Linux**: Comfortable with Arch Linux and Linux system tasks.
- 🐳 **Docker**: Experiences in self-hosting (deploying, creation).

## Self-Hosting Enthusiast
I enjoy self-hosting applications as an alternative to monthly subscriptions 😵. Some of the applications I've hosted include:
- 📽️ Jellyfin
- 🔐 Bitwarden/Vaultwarden
- 🌐 Wireguard
- ☁️ Nextcloud

## Location
- 📌 Based in Singen (Htw.), Germany

## Current Activities
📖 **Rust:** Currently diving into Rust programming. It's fascinating for its efficiency, memory safety, and versatility. My goal for the future is to develop smaller desktop applications and program my Arduino.

## Collaborations
- 💬 Open to collaborations on interesting projects.
- 📧 Feel free to reach out for collaboration opportunities.
